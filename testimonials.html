				<p class="t1">"Wow! I was using Excel to figure out who I hadn't called in a while and who I needed to get coffee with. Socialfly automates this for me - pretty brilliant!" - Nancy, Idaho USA</p>

				<p class="t2">"I appreciate the app.  It has helped me keep up with friends with my busy and hectic life.  I try to get in touch with as many as possible and several friends that I constantly let fall through the cracks have actually noticed my recent increase in efforts. Thanks! :)" - Mike, New York USA</p>
				<p class="t2" style="clear:left">"When I was looking for a job, I added my leads to Socialfly. I became so easy to stay in touch with recruiters every other day - and I didn't miss any detail in the conversations. It was all there in Socialfly, right where I needed it. It was fast and it worked!" - Brad, San Francisco USA</p>
				<p class="t2">"Great job guys! I always have a set of notes in my bag for when I meet new people. I use the cards to help me remember basic details on them. Now there is finally a simple way to store that information, so I don't need piles of notes any more! A mobile version would be even better, then I could finally stop carrying around those cards" - Yang-Yu, Palo Alto</p>
